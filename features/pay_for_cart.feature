      | example@example.com | password           |

    And the following user is signed in
      | email               | encrypted_password |
      | example@example.com | password           |

    Given the following restaurants with associations exist
      | name  | address                       | description         | res_category_name | menu_name |
      | Yappi | Hamngatan 37 111 53 Stockholm | Some hip thai place | Japanese          | Lunch     |

    And "2" "Dumplings" is added to my cart
    And I navigate to the index page

    And I fill in my card details on the stripe form
    And I submit the stripe form
    Then I should be on the payment confirmation page
    And I should see the text "Thanks, you paid 300"
