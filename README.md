# Ufoods app

We created an app which allows users to order a food in a various restaurants nearby.
You sign up by creating an account with an email and password.
After logging in you will be allowed to choose a restaurant and order a food with delivery.
A user sees restaurants within their proximity which they can choose by category e.g Thai, Mexican, etc.

## Running the tests

For acceptance test we use Cucumber
- It runs automated acceptance tests written in a behavior-driven development (BDD) style. Central to the Cucumber BDD approach is its plain language parser called Gherkin. It allows expected software behaviors to be specified in a logical language that customers can understand.  

For unit tests we use Rspec
- It is a behavior-driven development (BDD) framework which is extensively used in the production applications. The basic idea behind this concept is that of Test Driven Development(TDD) where the tests are written first and the development is based on writing just enough code that will fulfill those tests followed by refactoring.  

Run rake to see all the tests pass.  

## Deployment
